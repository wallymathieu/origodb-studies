# origodb-studies [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/o35892lgj5r6f55j/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wallymathieu/origodb-studies/branch/master)

Trying out origo db with same model from the [NHibernate Studies](https://github.com/wallymathieu/nhibernate-studies) project.

## Intro

In order to help with self studies of OrigoDb I've created this sample project. 

The code is a heavily modified fork of the code from [Summer Of NHibernate](http://summerofnhibernate.com/).
So, there is nothing really special about this project.
